# ml_defaults
Sets of up to 32 default values for several machine-learning algorithms

Sets of defaults can be used to select a configuration using appropriate resampling methods such as cross-validation. 
As defaults are found hierarchically, a smaller, *best* subset of size **t** can be obtained by simply retrieving the first **t** values.
